title: Redelegate
description: Transfer stake from one validator to another within the pool.
---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Instruction Index | 22 |
| Required Authority | Staker |
| Status | Deprecated |

The `Redelegate` instruction transfers stake from one validator to another within the pool. This uses the native stake program's redelegate feature.

> **Note**: This instruction is deprecated. Consider using decrease + increase operations instead for more predictable behavior.

## Arguments

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lamports` | u64 | Amount to redelegate |
| `source_transient_stake_seed` | u64 | Source transient seed |
| `ephemeral_stake_seed` | u64 | Ephemeral stake seed |
| `dest_transient_stake_seed` | u64 | Destination transient seed |

## Alternative Approach

Instead of `Redelegate`, use:

```typescript
// 1. Decrease stake from source validator
await decreaseValidatorStake(pool, sourceValidator, amount);

// 2. Wait for next epoch
await waitForNextEpoch();

// 3. Update pool to merge deactivated stake to reserve
await updateValidatorListBalance(pool);

// 4. Increase stake to destination validator
await increaseValidatorStake(pool, destValidator, amount);
```

## Errors

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `SignatureMissing` | Staker didn't sign |
| `ValidatorNotFound` | Validator not in pool |
| `InsufficientFunds` | Insufficient source stake |
