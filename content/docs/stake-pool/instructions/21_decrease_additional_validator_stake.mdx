## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Instruction Index | 21 |
| Required Authority | Staker |

The `DecreaseAdditionalValidatorStake` instruction decreases stake from a validator when a transient stake account already exists. It uses ephemeral stake accounts for atomic same-epoch operations.

## Accounts

| Index | Name | Writable | Signer | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Stake Pool | ❌ | ❌ | Stake pool account |
| 1 | Staker | ❌ | ✅ | Pool's staker authority |
| 2 | Withdraw Authority | ❌ | ❌ | Pool's withdraw authority PDA |
| 3 | Validator List | ✅ | ❌ | Pool's validator list account |
| 4 | Reserve Stake | ✅ | ❌ | Pool's reserve stake account |
| 5 | Validator Stake | ✅ | ❌ | Validator's main stake PDA |
| 6 | Ephemeral Stake | ✅ | ❌ | Temporary stake account PDA |
| 7 | Transient Stake | ✅ | ❌ | Validator's transient stake PDA |
| 8 | Clock Sysvar | ❌ | ❌ | Clock sysvar |
| 9 | Stake History | ❌ | ❌ | Stake history sysvar |
| 10 | System Program | ❌ | ❌ | System program |
| 11 | Stake Program | ❌ | ❌ | Native stake program |

## Arguments

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lamports` | u64 | Amount to unstake |
| `transient_stake_seed` | u64 | Seed for transient stake PDA |
| `ephemeral_stake_seed` | u64 | Seed for ephemeral stake PDA |

## Behavior

1. Splits stake from validator stake to ephemeral account
2. Deactivates ephemeral stake
3. Merges ephemeral stake into existing transient stake
4. Updates validator's transient stake balance

## When to Use

Use this instead of `DecreaseValidatorStakeWithReserve` when:
- A transient stake already exists for this validator
- You need multiple stake decreases in the same epoch

## Errors

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `SignatureMissing` | Staker didn't sign |
| `ValidatorNotFound` | Validator not in pool |
| `InsufficientFunds` | Insufficient validator stake |
| `WrongStakeState` | No existing transient stake |
