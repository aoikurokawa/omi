# Solana Staking Deep Dive

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Solana staking mechanisms. This documentation covers three key components of the Solana staking ecosystem:

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Stake Program
The native Solana staking program that handles delegation of SOL to validators. Understanding this is fundamental to all other staking mechanisms.

### 2. SPL Stake Pool
Liquid staking solution that allows users to stake SOL and receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in return. This enables DeFi composability while earning staking rewards.

### 3. Jito StakeNet
Advanced validator management system that includes the Steward Program for automated stake delegation based on validator performance metrics.

## Why This Matters

Staking is the backbone of Solana's security model. By understanding these systems, you can:

- Make informed decisions about where to stake your SOL
- Build applications that integrate with staking
- Understand how liquid staking tokens work
- Learn how validator selection and delegation is automated

Let's dive in!
