title: MoveStake
description: Transfer delegated stake between two stake accounts.
---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Instruction Index | 16 |
| Estimated CU | ~21,700 |

The `MoveStake` instruction transfers a portion of delegated stake from one account to another. Both accounts must be delegated to the same validator.

## Accounts

| Index | Name | Writable | Signer | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Source Stake Account | ✅ | ❌ | Account to transfer stake from |
| 1 | Destination Stake Account | ✅ | ❌ | Account to receive stake |
| 2 | Stake Authority | ❌ | ✅ | Stake authority for both accounts |

## Arguments

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lamports` | u64 | Amount of stake to move |

## Requirements

- Both accounts must be active (fully activated)
- Both accounts must be delegated to the same validator
- Both accounts must have the same stake authority
- Source must retain minimum delegation after transfer
- Destination must have at least minimum delegation

## Difference from Split

| Feature | MoveStake | Split |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Destination state | Must be initialized & delegated | Must be uninitialized |
| Same validator | Required | N/A (destination inherits) |
| Creates new account | No | Yes |
| Transfers delegation | Yes | Creates new delegation |

## Examples

### Rust

```rust
use solana_sdk::{
    instruction::{AccountMeta, Instruction},
    pubkey::Pubkey,
    stake::program::id as stake_program_id,
};

fn move_stake_instruction(
    source: &Pubkey,
    destination: &Pubkey,
    authority: &Pubkey,
    lamports: u64,
) -> Instruction {
    let mut data = vec![16, 0, 0, 0]; // Instruction index 16
    data.extend_from_slice(&lamports.to_le_bytes());
    
    Instruction {
        program_id: stake_program_id(),
        accounts: vec![
            AccountMeta::new(*source, false),
            AccountMeta::new(*destination, false),
            AccountMeta::new_readonly(*authority, true),
        ],
        data,
    }
}
```
