## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Instruction Index | 10 |
| Estimated CU | ~10,200 |

import { StakeProgram, StakeAuthorizationType } from '@solana/web3.js';

const authorizeCheckedIx = StakeProgram.authorizeChecked({
  stakePubkey: stakeAccountPubkey,
  authorizedPubkey: currentAuthority.publicKey,
  newAuthorizedPubkey: newAuthority.publicKey, // Must also sign
  stakeAuthorizationType: StakeAuthorizationType.Staker,
});

await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [
  payer,
  currentAuthority,
  newAuthority, // Required!
]);
```
