---



## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Instruction Index | 9 |
| Estimated CU | ~5,200 |

This provides additional safety by ensuring the withdraw authority is aware of and consents to being assigned. No lockup can be set with this instruction.

## Accounts

| Index | Name | Writable | Signer | Description |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Stake Account | ✅ | ❌ | The stake account to initialize |
| 1 | Rent Sysvar | ❌ | ❌ | `SysvarRent111111111111111111111111111111111` |
| 2 | Stake Authority | ❌ | ❌ | Authority for delegation operations |
| 3 | Withdraw Authority | ❌ | ✅ | Authority for withdrawal operations (must sign) |

## Arguments

None (authorities are passed as accounts).

## Example

```typescript
import { StakeProgram } from '@solana/web3.js';

const initCheckedIx = StakeProgram.initializeChecked({
  stakePubkey: stakeAccount.publicKey,
  authorized: {
    staker: stakeAuthority.publicKey,
    withdrawer: withdrawAuthority.publicKey,  // Must also sign tx
  },
});

const tx = new Transaction().add(createAccountIx, initCheckedIx);

// Both payer and withdrawAuthority must sign
await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [
  payer,
  stakeAccount,
  withdrawAuthority,  // Required signer
]);
```

## When to Use

Use `InitializeChecked` when:
- Setting up stake accounts for others
- Requiring explicit consent from the withdraw authority
- Building secure custodial systems

Use `Initialize` when:
- You control both authorities
- You need to set a lockup
- Simpler transaction structure is preferred
